### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Sorting Contact List

#### Overview of SortCommand
This feature allows users to sort their addressbook based on various information, namely name, company
name, interview time, salary and priority. This feature leverages on the built-in `ObservableList` provided by JavaFX.
The sorting is done by creating classes that implements the Comparator<T> interface.

#### Comparator Classes
* `PersonCompanyNameComparator.java`
* `PersonInterviewTimeComparator.java`
* `PersonNameComparator.java`
* `PersonPriorityComparator.java`
* `PersonSalaryComparator.java`

These comparators are referenced in the `SortCommandParser`. In the `SortCommandParser` each comparator will be assigned
a static integer based on the CLI Syntax from the userInput. The string is that parsed and assigned an integer from 
**1 - 4** which are pre-assigned to a comparator.

![job_difficulty_class](images/sort_overview_2.png)

**Process**:
1. User inputs `sort pri/`, triggering the `execute()` function in the `LogicManager` object.
    - `pri/` is a CLI syntax added to refer to priority, an attribute added to the `Person` class.
2. `LogicManager` invokes the `parseCommand()` function in the `AddressBookParser`, which interprets the 
`sort` command and creates a `SortCommandParser` object.
3. The `SortCommandParser` parses `pri/` and creates the `SortCommand` object.
    - The `SortCommand` constructor accepts an **Integer**, with `SortCommandParser` pre-assigning `pri/` to 0.
4. `LogicManager` executes the command.
5. `SortCommand` calls `updateSortedPersonList()` from the `Model` object, which references the 
`AddressBook` containing the `UniquePersonList`. The `UniquePersonList` sorts based on the assigned comparator.

#### Class Structure
- `SortCommand` class: Responsible for executing the sort operation based on the specified attribute. Inherits from the 
`Command` class and utilizes multiple comparator classes to sort contacts based on various attributes.

#### Method Details
- `SortCommand(Integer info, boolean isInverse)`: Constructor that takes an integer representing the attribute index 
and a boolean indicating whether to sort in reverse order.
- `execute(Model model)`: Executes the command to sort the list of contacts in the address book based on the specified 
attribute. Utilises switch-case statements to select the appropriate comparator and sorts the contacts accordingly.
- `equals(Object other)`: Overrides the equals method to compare if two `SortCommand` objects are equal based on the 
attribute index.

### Job Difficulty Feature
![job_difficulty_class](images/JobDifficultyDiagram.png)

#### Overview of Job Difficulty Feature
The job difficulty feature calculates a difficulty score for a job based on the company name and salary. It utilises 
the local storage of renowned company names and their job difficulty levels.

#### Class Structure
- `JobDifficulty` class: Responsible for computing the job difficulty score. Utilizes `CompanyName` and `Salary` 
classes to fetch the necessary information.

#### Method Details
- `JobDifficulty(CompanyName companyName, Salary salary)`: Constructor that takes a `CompanyName` object and a `Salary` 
object to compute the job difficulty score.
- `getDifficulty()`: Returns the calculated job difficulty score.

### Filtering of List Feature

#### Overview of Filtering List Feature
This feature allows users to filter their lists according to the interview time range, tags, salary range 
and programming language.

#### Implementation
- `FilterCommand` class: An abstract class inherited by concrete classes, such as `FilterInterviewTimeCommand`, 
`FilterTagCommand`, `FilterSalaryCommand`, and `FilterProgrammingLanguageCommand`. These classes filter the list 
according to their respective categories.

**Process:**
1. `FilterCommandParser` determines a concrete subclass of `FilterCommand` to return.
2. The concrete `FilterCommandClass` checks if their respective categories (interview times, tags, etc.) in the contact list contain the keyword.
3. Returns the list of contacts containing the keyword.

### Deleting Contacts With Same Tag Feature



#### Overview of DeletingTagCommand
The `DeleteTagCommand` feature enables users to delete all contacts associated with a specified tag from the address 
book. This feature uses the `TagContainsKeywordsPredicate` class to filter and identify contacts with the specified tag for deletion.

**Process**:
1. `DeleteTagCommandParser` determines a concrete subclass of `DeleteTagCommand` to return.
2. The concrete `DeleteTagCommand` class retrieves the list of tags to be deleted from the 
`TagContainsKeywordsPredicate`.
4. Filters the contacts in the address book based on these tags.
5. Deletes the filtered contacts from the address book model.

#### Class Structure
- `DeleteTagCommand` class: Responsible for executing the delete operation based on the specified tag. Inherits from 
the `DeleteAbstractCommand` class and utilizes the `TagContainsKeywordsPredicate` class to filter contacts.

#### Method Details
- `DeleteTagCommand(TagContainsKeywordsPredicate tagToDelete)`: Constructor that takes a `TagContainsKeywordsPredicate` 
object representing the tag to be deleted.
- `execute(Model model)`: Executes the command to delete all contacts with the specified tag from the address book. 
Retrieves the list of tags to be deleted, filters the contacts based on these tags, and deletes them from the model.

### Finding Contact Name by Company Name Feature

#### Overview of FindCommand
The `FindCommand` feature allows users to search and list all persons in the address book whose name or company name 
contains any of the specified keywords. This feature employs the `NameOrCompanyNameContainsKeywordsPredicate` class to 
filter and identify contacts based on their names or company names.

**Process**:
`FindCommandParser` determines a concrete subclass of `FindCommand` to return.
The concrete `FindCommand` class checks if the names or company names of contacts in the address book contain the 
specified keywords. It returns the list of contacts whose names or company names contain the keyword.

#### Class Structure
- `FindCommand` class: Responsible for executing the find operation based on the specified keywords. Inherits from the 
`Command` class and utilizes the `NameOrCompanyNameContainsKeywordsPredicate` class to filter contacts.

#### Method Details
- `FindCommand(NameOrCompanyNameContainsKeywordsPredicate predicate)`: Constructor that takes a 
`NameOrCompanyNameContainsKeywordsPredicate` object representing the keywords to search for.
- `execute(Model model)`: Executes the command to find and list all contacts whose names or company names contain the 
specified keywords. Retrieves the list of contacts matching the predicate, updates the filtered contact list in the 
model, and returns a command result indicating the number of contacts found.

### Non-Functional Requirements

1.  Should work on any _mainstream OS_ as long as it has Java `11` or above installed.
2.  Should be able to hold up to 1000 persons without a noticeable sluggishness in performance for typical usage.
3.  A user with above average typing speed for regular English text (i.e. not code, not system admin commands) should be able to accomplish most of the tasks faster using commands than using the mouse.
4.  User Interface should be intuitive enough for users to easily add interview dates and salaries.
5.  System should be able to cater to various date formats given by users.
6.  System should be able to handle a minimum of 100 contacts

*{More to be added}*

### Glossary

* **Computer Science job seeker** : Student / Unemployed / Working adult seeking employment opportunities in the field of Computer Science
* **Mainstream OS**: Windows, Linux, Unix, MacOS
* **Private contact detail**: A contact detail that is not meant to be shared with others 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**

Team size: 5
1. **Allow `filter` command to filter the contact list based on a combination of categories**: The current `filter` 
   command only allows the contact list to be filtered based on one specific category such as tags, salary range etc 
   and this may not be useful for users with a very huge number of contacts as filtering by only one category may still
   return a long list. It is also not convenient for users who want to find contacts more specifically. We plan to 
   allow `filter` to filter the contact list more specifically. (e.g. `filter t/TAG s/SALARY_RANGE` will return 
   contacts with matching `TAG` and `SALARY_RANGE` that falls within what is specified)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
